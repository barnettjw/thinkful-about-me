      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I got my start working on a helpdesk and worked my way to being a <strong>Systems Administrator</strong>. Working in technical support is where I learned about satisfying it is to help people solve their problems.</p>
      <p>My love of building things on the web started when I was setting up a network monitoring system at work and my boss asked if we could put it on a TV so our customers could see it when they came to visit the datacenter. So I created a custom dashboard
      and that was my first exposure to CSS.</p>
      <p>Since then I've been hooked on the power to <em>come up with an idea and actually build it myself</em>.</p>
      <p>I'm passionate about good documentation, <strong>great UX</strong> and helping people solve their own problems.</p>

      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I grew up in Northern Virginia outside of DC. Which means everyone is always talking about either politics or the traffic.</p>
      <p>Fun fact, my backyard growing up was litterally a National Park, the area started out as a CCC Camp and was converted into an area managed by the National Park Service after World War II.</P>
